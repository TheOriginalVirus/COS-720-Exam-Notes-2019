## Threat

| Threat            | Consequence                    | Severity        | Ease of Exploitation   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Integrity Failure | Malicious code causing unexpected and unauthorized behavior | Very Serious  | Generally easy |

## Vulnrability

| Vulnrability                       | Exploitability    | Prevalence            |
|------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Forgery: email, website, code      | Easy              | Extremely Prevalent   |
| Code installation                  | Easy              | Quite Prevalent       |
| Humans                             | Easy              | Quite Prevalent       |

## Countermeasure

| Countermeasures   | Issues Addressed    | Mitigation Type | Mitigation Effect | Effort    |
|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Digital Signature | Code and document authenticity | Detection |Very Strong| Relatively Low |
| Separation        | Integrity Failure   | Prevention      | Very Strong | Low |
| Trust, user awareness and education     | Human weakness      | Prevention detection | Moderate needs to be repeated as attacks change               | Moderate      |
